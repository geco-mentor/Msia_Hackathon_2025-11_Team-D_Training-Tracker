# AI-Driven Skill Growth Platform - Demo Storyline

This story follows the journey of talent development from three perspectives: the Employee (John), the Manager (Daniel), and the Administrator (Admin Adam).

## Act 1: The Employee's Ambition (John)
**Theme**: Self-Driven Growth & AI Personalization

1.  **Character Intro**: Meet **John**, an employee eager to advance his career but unsure of the specific steps needed.
2.  **The Guide (GROW Model)**: John opens the **GROW Model Dynamic [AI]** feature. 
    *   *Narrative*: He interacts with the AI coach, which helps him articulate his Goal (Promote to Senior Dev), assess his Reality, explore Options, and commit to a Will. The AI suggests he lacks specific GenAI proficiencies.
3.  **The Test (Personalized Assessment)**: To verify his "Reality", John clicks **Take Personalized Assessment [AI]**.
    *   *Narrative*: The system generates a unique set of questions based on the gaps identified in the GROW session. He takes the test.
4.  **The Feedback (Assessment Results)**: Immediately after, he sees his **Assessment** score.
    *   *Narrative*: He gets instant feedback—he's strong in Python but weak in Prompt Engineering.
5.  **The Record (My Profile)**: John checks **My Profile**.
    *   *Narrative*: His updated skill ratings and completed assessments are logged here, showing his growth trajectory.

## Act 2: The Manager's Oversight (Daniel)
**Theme**: Team Calibration & Activity Monitoring

6.  **Character Intro**: Switch to **Daniel**, John's manager, who needs to ensure his team is up-skilling effectively.
7.  **The Grid (Skill Matrix)**: Daniel views the **Skill Matrix**.
    *   *Narrative*: He sees a bird's-eye view of his team's proficiency. He notices John's green bar in Python but the gap in AI skills, validating John's self-assessment.
8.  **The Pulse (Department Activeness)**: He checks **His Department Activeness**.
    *   *Narrative*: He sees the team is actively engaging with the platform, with a spike in activity recently (thanks to John and others).

## Act 3: The Architect's Strategy (Admin Adam)
**Theme**: Organizational Impact & Strategic Intervention

9.  **Character Intro**: Switch to **Adam**, the Admin/HR Executive, looking at the big picture.
10. **The Audit (Department Act Log)**: Adam reviews the **Department Act Log**.
    *   *Narrative*: He verifies that the Engineering department is the most active, while Sales is lagging.
11. **The ROI (Training Impact Analysis)**: He opens **Training Impact Analysis**.
    *   *Narrative*: He correlates training completion with performance metrics. Is the GenAI training actually improving output?
12. **The Trend (Skill Adoption Matrix [AI])**: He uses the **Skill Adoption Matrix [AI]**.
    *   *Narrative*: The AI highlights an emerging trend—"Prompt Engineering" is being adopted quickly in Engineering but not in Product.
13. **The Deep Dive (Review Worker's Stat)**: Adam drills down to **Review Worker's Stat**.
    *   *Narrative*: He looks up John specifically to see a model of a "good learner" to benchmark others against.
14. **The Intervention (Create Assessment [AI])**: Seeing a general gap in "Advanced Ethics", Adam decides to push a new initiative. He uses **Create Assessment [AI]**.
    *   *Narrative*: Instead of writing questions manually, he asks the AI to "Design a 10-question assessment on AI Ethics for Developers." The AI generates it instantly, and he publishes it to the organization.

---
**Conclusion**: The loop is closed. John identifies a need, Daniel monitors the team, and Adam facilitates the ecosystem, all powered by AI.
